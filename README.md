## Installation
This project is built on [platform.io](http://docs.platformio.org). All dependencies are automatically installed, if you use it. I recommend to use it [together with Visual Studio Code](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html).

It's also possible to use the Arduino IDE, then you have to install the required libraries manually (see tetris_clock.ino).

## Wiring
This project is based on the famous PxMatrix library. For wiring the matrix, see the excellent instructions [here](https://github.com/2dom/PxMatrix/).
